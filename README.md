Blockchain Using C 

Overview: 

This project implements a basic blockchain in C++, designed to demonstrate the core principles of blockchain technology. The main component is the Blockchain class, which manages a sequence of blocks, each linked to its predecessor by a cryptographic hash. The blockchain is initialized with a genesis block, and subsequent blocks are added through the AddBlock method. This method ensures that each new block references the hash of the previous block, maintaining the integrity and immutability of the chain.

The AddBlock method also handles the mining process, which involves finding a nonce that, when combined with the block's data, produces a hash that meets a predefined difficulty level. This proof-of-work mechanism is crucial for securing the blockchain, as it makes it computationally challenging to alter any block without re-mining all subsequent blocks. The _nDifficulty member variable specifies the number of leading zeros required in the hash, and the MineBlock function iteratively adjusts the nonce until the hash meets this criterion. This process ensures that adding a new block requires significant computational effort, thereby deterring malicious attempts to manipulate the blockchain.

Overall, this project provides a foundational understanding of blockchain mechanics, including the concepts of linked blocks, proof-of-work, and decentralized consensus. By implementing these features in C++, developers can gain practical insights into how blockchains maintain security and integrity in a distributed environment. This basic implementation serves as a stepping stone for exploring more advanced blockchain technologies and developing applications that leverage the unique properties of blockchain systems.
